# woocomAdditions
Some interesting modifications to WooCommerce I needed at work - I guess I could have created a WooCommerce plugin but I'm a bit more used to creating WordPress plugins so...

## What it do?
1. Adds a custom field `tagline` under each product title in the shop loop

## Install
1. Clone/download zip
2. Ensure all contents are in `/wp-content/plugins/woocomAdditions`
3. Enable plugin
